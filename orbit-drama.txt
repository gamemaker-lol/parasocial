I am NOT apart of Orbit anymore.

I deleted the domain on FreeDNS (https://freedns.afraid.org/), and someone TOOK that domain and now has an indefinitely loading page as I am typing this (7/11/25).
Before this, the domain was just had a black background with text (unfortunately, there is no archive of "orbit.nekoweb.org") that blended into the page, basically an iframe.
The one IP to the domain was GitHub Pages (185.199.111.153)
