I am NOT apart of Orbit anymore.

I deleted the domain on FreeDNS (https://freedns.afraid.org/), and someone GRABBED that domain, and now has an indefinitely loading page as I am typing this (7/11/25).
Before this, the domain was just had a black background with text (unfortunately, there is no archive of "orbit.nekoweb.org") that blended into the page, basically an iframe.
The one IP to the domain was GitHub Pages (185.199.111.153)

To clarify, Github Pages has VERY good security, and I have 2FA on my Github account.
Saying that some users repository using a multi-million dollar company's product got "hacked" is illogical.

At this time, ojthedev (https://discord.com/users/1384576852781432904) has blocked me.

I HAVE to redact the FreeDNS link.
